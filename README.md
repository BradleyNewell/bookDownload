# bookDownload
Download .txt files from gutenberg.org using Python with the BeautifulSoup, urllib and the io libraries.

This script will take a url and write all text from that source and write it to a file which can be named by the user but by default
it is named "WarandPeace.txt".
To change the name simply edit the text between "edit_this_text.txt" taking care to leave the quotation marks and .txt enclosed between
them.

To change the source of the text you wish to download you change the URL located within the html variable within the code.

Enjoy!

Thank you to project gutenberg which hosts all of these books free for everyone.
